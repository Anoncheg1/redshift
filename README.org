* Description
Change screen from red to blue temperature color according to current
 time or manually.

It takes arise and sunset time and calc middle of the day. Then calc
 if it is going to be sunset or it is going to be arise according to
 current time. Color changes from middle of the day to middle of the
 night and reverse by hours.

At the middle of the day it makes screen blue and at the middle of the
 night red.

If there is a gap in day or night, then in this gap temperature stay fixed.

The idea was taken from https://github.com/jonls/redshift/ but not to
 help eyes, but as an experiment to make body understand current time.

This is a simple bash script that get current time and set your screen
 more red or blue according to current time.

This script uses "colorramp" from Redshift of jonls, which is Ingo
 Thies, 2013.

This script have code to calculate middle of the day and middle of the
 night and percentage of sun rising and sunset. You can use it for
 Salat or Namaz calculation for Muslims or something like that.

This script don't change brightness but it is degrading at high blue and red.

* Requirements
This script depends on xranr https://www.x.org/wiki/Projects/XRandR/

Check that xrandr exist at PATH:
#+begin_src bash
xrandr
#+end_src
* Usage

Execute script to shell:
#+begin_src bash
source /home/user/git_cloned_sources/redshift/redshift.sh
#+end_src

Then call following command to get time and adjust screen:
#+begin_src bash
do_redshift
#+end_src

To set RED-BLUE manually call following command with value between 0 and 100
#+begin_src bash
redshift 99
#+end_src

To set display back to normal:
#+begin_src bash
redshift normal
#+end_src

To test full circle use command:
#+begin_src bash
test_do_redshift
#+end_src


If at the middle of the day BLUE is too active you can decrease it with increasing value of TOO_MUCH_BLUE, same for red.

* Configuration
Set variables R and S inside of the script
 https://github.com/Anoncheg1/redshift/blob/main/redshift.sh#L586
 This is time of raising and sunset. You can get this values at
 internet according to your region and season.

#+begin_src bash
declare -i R=2 # ARAISE - 2:00 time of sun rising
declare -i S=19 # SUNSET - 19:00 time of sunset
declare -i day_gap=0 # gap in the middle of the day
declare -i night_gap=10 # gap in the middle of the night when it is always red
#+end_src
* Automatic activation
You can activate command when you do other frequently used commands:
#+begin_src bash
alias ls="do_redshift ; ls"
#+end_src

Or add command to *Cron* daemon with hour period:
#+begin_src bash
sudo cron -e
# and add this line:
0 * * * * source /home/user/git_cloned_sources/redshift/redshift.sh ; do_redshift >/dev/null
#+end_src
